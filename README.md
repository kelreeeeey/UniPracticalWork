# Fault analysis toolbox - tutorials

![alt text](https://github.com/thilowrona/fault_analysis_toolbox/blob/master/fault_network.png)

This is the companion repository to the [fault analysis toolbox](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox) containing a series of tutorials. You can also find our documentation of the toolbox at: [https://fatbox.readthedocs.io/](https://fatbox.readthedocs.io/).

## Numerical models
First, we will look at fault analyses in numerical models. One of the easiest ways of getting started is with Jupyter notebooks - an awesome combination of code, documentation and output. The easiest way is to run them with Google Colab, so you don't need any special hardware or software. Just try it out:

### [Tutorial 1: Fault extraction](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/1-fault_extraction/1-fault_extraction.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to extract a fault network from a 2-D slice of a numerical model

### [Tutorial 2: Fault properties](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/2-fault_properties/2-fault_properties.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to calculate the strike and length of the extracted faults

### [Tutorial 3: Time stepping](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/3-time_stepping/3-time_stepping.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to track fault networks through time in numerical models

### [Tutorial 4: Fault slip](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/4-fault_slip/4-fault_slip.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to calculate fault slip from numerical models

### [Tutorial 5: Displacement](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/5-displacement/5-displacement.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to sum up fault slip to displacement through time

### [Tutorial 6: Fault evolution](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/6-evolution/6-evolution.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to visualize the evolution of our faults with time


### Extra tutorials
### [Tutorial E1](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/E1-manual_extraction/E1-manual_extraction.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to map fault networks by hand

### [Tutorial E2](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/E2-paraview/E2-paraview.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to resample a 2-D numerical model to an array with Paraview, so we can apply our workflow

### [Tutorial E3](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/E3-export/E3-export.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to export our fault network for 3-D visualizations in Paraview
